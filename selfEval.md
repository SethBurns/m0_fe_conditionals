# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

- I feel good about my understanding of comparison operators. This part of the work seemed pretty straight forward to me.

3. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

- I feel good about them. I'm feeling like I'm starting to get into the fun part of coding, where more things are becoming possible and it's exciting.

5. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

About 4/5, I was really excited to figure some stuff out without googling it. Rubber duck method for the win. But some more practice will help solidify this!

7. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

- I spent about 1.5 hours doing this assignment. So far assignments have gone faster for me, but I did productively struggle a couple times on this assignment so it took me maybe 50% longer to accomplish.

9. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

- I have some fun ideas to use what I've learned so far to try to code a "name game" where you change the variable to your name, and the output produces "Seth, Seth, bo Beth, banananfana fo Feth.... etc." I feel like I'll need to look up how to break a string's characters into an array for that, but it'll be good practice.

11. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

- I can't think of any questions off hand, but google has helped answer most my questions so far, and the support from Kim and my small group has been helpful.
